				<p class="pb-4">
					THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES SO ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY
					OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY ("Customer"); SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND
					WARRANTS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS
					AGREEMENT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE

					DEFINITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="pb-4">1. The Service.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					1.1. <span class="underline">Service Description</span>. Squared is
					the owner and provider of a cloud-based software for product teams
					(the "Service"). Anything Customer (including Users) posts, uploads,
					shares, stores, or otherwise provide through the Service is considered
					a "User Submission." Customer is solely responsible for all User
					Submissions it contributes to the Service. Further terms regarding
					User Submissions, including ownership, are in Section 8.2 below. The
					Service may also include templates, help documents, and other
					documents or information that can assist Customer using the Service
					("Squared Content"). Customer will not receive or have access to the
					code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the
					"Software") or receive a copy of the Software itself.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					1.2. <span class="underline">Customer's Subscription</span>. Subject
					to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may purchase a subscription
					to, and has the right to access and use, the Service as specified in
					one or more ordering screens agreed to by the parties through
					Squared's website that reference this Agreement and describe the
					business terms related to Customer's subscription ("Order(s)"). All
					subscriptions will be for the period described on the applicable Order
					("Subscription Period"). Use of and access to the Service is permitted
					only by individuals authorized by Customer and for Customer's own
					internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party
					("Users").
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					1.3. <span class="underline">Squared's Ownership</span>. Squared owns
					the Service, Software, Squared Content, Documentation, and anything
					else provided by Squared to Customer (collectively the "Squared
					Materials"). Squared retains all right, title and interest (including,
					without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademarks, trade secret
					and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Squared
					Materials, all related and underlying technology and any updates,
					enhancements, upgrades, modifications, patches, workarounds, and fixes
					thereto and all derivative works of or modifications to any of the
					foregoing. There are no implied licenses under this Agreement and any
					rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement are
					expressly reserved by Squared.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					1.4. <span class="underline">Permissions</span>. The Service contains
					customizable settings allowing each User to give permission to other
					Users to perform various tasks within the Service ("Permissions"). It
					is also solely Customer's responsibility to set and manage all
					Permissions, including which Users can set such Permissions.
					Accordingly, Squared will have no responsibility for managing
					Permissions and no liability for the Permissions set by Customer and
					its Users. Customer may, at its option, provide access to the Service
					and Documentation to its Affiliates (defined below), in which case all
					rights granted, and obligations incurred, under this Agreement will
					also inure to the benefit of such Affiliates. Customer represents and
					warrants that it is fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement
					by its Affiliates and that Customer has the power to negotiate this
					Agreement on behalf of its Affiliates. Customer will also be
					responsible for all payment obligations under this Agreement
					regardless of whether the use of the Service is by Customer or its
					Affiliates. Any claim by an Affiliate against Squared will be brought
					by Customer and not the Affiliate. For the purposes of this Agreement
					"Affiliate" will mean of a party will mean an entity directly or
					indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with
					that party (where "control" means the ownership or control, directly
					or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of all the voting
					power of the shares (or other securities or rights) entitled to vote
					for the election of directors or other governing authority.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="pb-4">2. Restrictions.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					2.1. <span class="underline">Customer's Responsibilities</span>.
					Customer is responsible for all activity on its Users' accounts unless
					such activity is caused by a third party bad actor able to access
					Customer's account by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Service
					itself. Customer will ensure that its Users are aware of and bound by
					obligations and/or restrictions stated in this Agreement and Customer
					will be responsible for breach of any such obligation and/or
					restriction by a User.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					2.2. <span class="underline">Use Restrictions</span>. Customer agrees
					that it will not, and will not allow Users or third parties to,
					directly or indirectly (a) modify, translate, copy or create
					derivative works based on the Service, (b) reverse assemble, reverse
					compile, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover
					the object code, source code, non-public APIs or underlying ideas or
					algorithms of the Service, except as and only to the extent this
					restriction is prohibited by law, (c) license, sublicense, sell,
					resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or
					otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any
					third party, other than Authorized Customers, (d) remove or obscure
					any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices, legends or
					Squared branding contained in or on the Service, (e) use the Service
					in any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local or
					international law or regulation, (f) attempt to gain unauthorized
					access to, interfere with, damage or disrupt any parts of the Service,
					including, without limitation, by introducing viruses and other
					harmful code or by using flood pings, denial-of-service attacks, or
					similar methods or technology, (g) use or access the Service to build
					or support and/or assist a third party in building or supporting
					products or services competitive to the Service or (h) attempt to
					probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service or any Squared
					system or networks. If Customer (including Users) is using the Service
					in a manner that, in Squared's reasonable judgment, causes or is
					likely to cause significant harm to Squared or the Service or
					otherwise threatens the security, integrity or availability of the
					Service then Squared may suspend Customer's access to the Service.
					Squared will use commercially reasonable efforts under the
					circumstances of such suspension to (x) provide Customer with notice
					and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any
					such suspension; (y) limit the suspension to only accounts involved in
					the activities in question; and (z) remove the suspension as quickly
					as practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have
					been resolved.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					2.3. <span class="underline">API Access Restrictions</span>. As part
					of provision of its Service, Squared may provide Customer with access
					to one or more application program interfaces ("API(s)"). Squared may,
					in its sole discretion, set and enforce limits on Customer's use of
					the API and Customer agrees to adhere to such limits. Squared may also
					suspend Customer's access to the API or cease providing the API at any
					time.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="pb-4">
					3.<span class="underline">Third-Party Applications</span>. The Service
					may work together with third party products, services or applications
					that are not owned or controlled by Squared, (e.g., Github)
					("Third-Party Applications") and Customer, at its sole option, may
					choose to use such Third-Party Applications. If necessary for the
					Service and the Third-Party Application to work together, Customer
					will provide its login information to Squared for the sole purpose of
					Squared providing the Service to Customer and Customer represents and
					warrants that Customer has the right to provide such login information
					without breach by Customer of any of the terms and conditions that
					govern Customer's use of the applicable Third-Party Application.
					Squared does not endorse such Third-Party Applications. Customer
					acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not apply to
					Customer's use of such Third-Party Applications and Customer be
					required by the providers of such Third-Party Applications to enter
					into separate agreements for Customer's use. Squared expressly
					disclaims all representations and warranties relating to any
					Third-Party Applications. Customer will look solely to the providers
					of the Third-Party Applications for any warranty related issues or
					other claims. Customer's use of Third-Party Applications is at
					Customer's own risk. Squared will have no liability or other
					obligation of any kind arising out of or related to any third-party
					applications, including arising from Customer's use or inability to
					use Third-Party Applications.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="pb-4">4. Payment Obligations.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					4.1. <span class="underline">Fees</span>. Customer will pay for access
					to and use of the Service as set forth on the applicable Order
					("Fees"). All Fees will be paid in the currency stated in the
					applicable Order or, if no currency is specified, U.S. dollars.
					Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated
					in this Agreement, non-refundable. Squared may modify its Fees or
					introduce new fees in its sole discretion. Customer always has the
					right to choose not to renew its subscription if it does not agree
					with any new or revised Fees.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					4.2. <span class="underline">Payment</span>. Squared, either directly
					or through its third-party payment processor ("Payment Processor")
					will charge Customer for the Fees via credit card or ACH payment,
					pursuant to the credit card or ACH payment information provided by
					Customer to Squared. Squared will have the right to charge Customer's
					credit card or ACH payment method for any services provided to
					Customer by Squared under the Order, including recurring Fees. It is
					Customer's sole responsibility to provide Squared with current and up
					to date credit card or ACH information; failure to provide such
					information may result in suspension of Customer's access to the
					Services. Squared will also have the right to set-off any Fees due
					from Customer to Squared. If Customer pays the Fees through a Payment
					Processor such payment processing will be subject to the terms,
					conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition
					to this Agreement. Squared is not responsible for any error by, or
					other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. Squared reserves
					the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor
					makes even if Squared has already requested or received payment. If
					authorized by Customer through acceptance of an Order, recurring
					charges (e.g. monthly billing) will be charged to Customer's payment
					instrument without further authorization from Customer, until Customer
					terminates this Agreement in accordance with its terms or changes its
					payment method in Customer's account in the Service.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					4.3. <span class="underline">Taxes</span>. Fees do not include any
					taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any
					nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding
					taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively,
					"Taxes"). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with
					its purchases hereunder. If Squared has the legal obligation to pay or
					collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section,
					Squared will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless
					Customer provides Squared with a valid tax exemption certificate
					authorized by the appropriate taxing authority in advance. For
					clarity, Squared is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it
					based on its income, property, and employees.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					4.4. <span class="underline">Failure to Pay</span>. If Customer fails
					to pay any Fees when due, Squared may suspend Customer's access to the
					Service pending payment of such overdue amounts. Customer also
					authorizes Squared to make multiple re-attempts at charging the
					Customer's payment instrument if an initial charge attempt is
					unsuccessful, without any specific limit on the number of retries. If
					Customer believes that Squared has billed Customer incorrectly,
					Customer must contact Squared no later than sixty (60) days after the
					closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or
					problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or credit. Once Squared
					receives notice of a disputed invoice, Squared will review such notice
					and provide Customer with a written decision regarding the dispute,
					including documentary support for such decision. If Squared reasonably
					determines that the amounts billed are, in fact, due, Customer will
					pay such amounts (if it has not done so already) within ten (10) days
					of Squared notifying Customer in writing of such decision.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="pb-4">5. Term and Termination.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					5.1. <span class="underline">Agreement Term and Renewals</span>.
					Subscriptions to access and use the Service commence on the start date
					stated on the applicable Order("Subscription Start Date") and continue
					for the duration of the Subscription Period. Customer may choose not
					to renew its Subscription Period by notifying Squared at
					billing@Squared.app (provided that Squared confirms such cancellation
					in writing) or by modifying its subscription through Customer's
					account within the Service. This Agreement will become effective on
					the first day of the Subscription Period and remain effective for the
					duration of the Subscription Period stated on the Order along with any
					renewals of the Subscription Period and any period that Customer is
					using the Service even if such use is not under a paid Order ("Term").
					If the parties terminate this Agreement, it will automatically
					terminate all Orders. If Customer cancels or does not renew its paid
					subscription to the Service, Customer's subscription will be
					accessible but will automatically be downgraded to a version of the
					Service with diminished features and functionality that Squared offers
					to unpaid subscribers ("Free Version"). If Customer or Squared
					terminates this Agreement or Customer deletes its workspace within the
					Service, Customer will not have access to the Free Version.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					5.2. <span class="underline">Termination</span>. Either party may
					terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party if the
					other party materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not
					cured within thirty (30) days after the breaching party's receipt of
					such notice. Squared may terminate Customer's access to the Free
					Version at any time upon notice to Customer.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					5.3. <span class="underline">Effect of Termination</span>. If Customer
					terminates this Agreement because of Squared's uncured breach, Squared
					will refund any unused, prepaid Fees for the remainder of the
					then-current Subscription Period. If Squared terminates this Agreement
					because of Customer's uncured breach, Customer will pay any unpaid
					Fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period
					after the effective date of termination, if any. In no event will any
					termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable
					to Squared for the period prior to the effective date of termination.
					Upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and licenses
					granted by Squared hereunder will immediately terminate; Customer will
					no longer have the right to access or use the Service. Within thirty
					(30) days of termination of this Agreement for cause, upon Customer's
					request following termination, or if Customer deletes its workspace
					within the Service, Squared will delete Customer's User Information,
					including passwords and all related information, files, and User
					Submissions, unless Customer requests an earlier deletion in writing.
					If Customer is using the Free Version, Squared will retain User
					Submissions and User Information to facilitate such use. Squared may
					delete all User Submissions or User Information if Customer maintains
					an account in the Free Version but such account is not usedfor a
					period of one (1) year or more.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					5.4. <span class="underline">Survival</span>. Sections titled
					"Squared's Ownership", "Third-Party Applications", "Payment
					Obligations", "Term and Termination", "Warranty Disclaimer",
					"Limitation of Liability", "Confidentiality", "Data" and "General
					Terms" will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

					and warrants that all User Submissions submitted by Users follow all
					applicable laws, rules and regulations.

					WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND Squared EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
					ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
					IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
					PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT Squared DOES
					NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE,
					OR ERROR-FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF
					CERTAIN TYPES OF WARRANTIES. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY
					TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="pb-4">
					7. Limitation of Liability. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
					IN THIS AGREEMENT, Squared WILL NOT BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY
					CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN AN
					ACTION BASED ON A CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT
					LIABILITY) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING, FOR (A)

			<div>
				<h3 class="pb-4">8. Confidentiality.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					8.1. <span class="underline">Definition</span>. Each party (the
					"Receiving Party") understands that the other party (the "Disclosing
					Party") may disclose business, technical or financial information
					relating to the Disclosing Party's business that reasonably should be
					understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and
					the circumstances of disclosure (hereinafter referred to as the
					"Confidential Information" of the Disclosing Party). Squared's
					Confidential Information includes non-public information regarding
					features, functionality, and performance of the Service. Customer's
					Confidential Information includes the User Information and User
					Submissions. This Agreement and the information in all Orders will be
					deemed the Confidential Information of both parties. Notwithstanding
					the above, Confidential Information does not include information that
					(a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of
					any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the
					Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party
					without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is
					received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to
					the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the
					Receiving Party without use or reference to the Disclosing Party's
					Confidential Information.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					8.2. <span class="underline"
						>Protection and Use of Confidential Information</span
					>. The Receiving Party will (a) protect the Disclosing Party's
					Confidential Information using the same degree of care used to protect
					its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance,
					but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care, (b)
					limit access to the Confidential Information to those employees,
					affiliates, subcontractors, agents, consultants, legal advisors,
					financial advisors, and contractors ("Representatives") who need to
					know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are
					bound by confidentiality and non-use obligations just as protective of
					the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the terms of this
					Agreement; (c) except as expressly set forth herein, make all
					commercially reasonable efforts not to disclose any of Disclosing
					Party's Confidential Information to any third parties without the
					Disclosing Party's prior written consent; and (d) will not use the
					Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than
					to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing above will
					prevent either party from sharing the terms of this Agreement or the
					name of the other party with prospective investors or acquirors;
					provided, however, that the foregoing persons or entities are bound to
					standard confidentiality obligations.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					8.3. <span class="underline">Compelled Access or Disclosure</span>.
					The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of
					the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however, that
					the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the
					compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and
					reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the
					Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					8.4. <span class="underline">Feedback</span>. Customer may from time
					to time provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback with respect
					to the Service ("Feedback"). For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback will
					only refer to suggestions, comments or other feedback provided to
					Squared specifically regarding the Service and will not include User
					Information or User Submissions. Squared may want to incorporate
					Feedback into its Service and this clause provides Squared with the
					necessary license to do so. Customer hereby grant to Squared and
					Squared's assigns a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
					fully transferable and sublicensable right and license, if any, to
					use, disclose, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from,
					distribute, display, and otherwise distribute and exploit any Feedback
					as Squared sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any
					kind, except that Squared will not identify Customer as the provider
					of such Feedback.

				<h3 class="pb-4">9. Data.</h3>
				<p class="pb-4">
					9.1. <span class="underline">User Information</span>. Customer and its
					Users are required to provide information such as name, email address,

					Information") upon logging into the Service in order to access the
					Service. Customer grants Squared and its subcontractors the right to

					Agreement. Customer is responsible for all User Information.
					Accordingly, Customer is responsible for all resulting liability if

					to any third party, the parties agree that Squared is free to use the
					Service Data in any manner. Squared owns all right, title, and
					interest in and to such Service Data. For clarity, this section does
					not give Squared the right to identify Customer (including its Users)
					as the source of any Service Data.
				</p>
				<p class="pb-4">
					9.4. Data Protection.Squared has established and implemented
					reasonable information security practices regarding the protection of
					User Submissions and User Information (collectively "Customer Data"),
					including administrative, technical, and physical security processes.
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer is responsible for maintaining
					appropriate security, protection and backup of its hardware, software,
